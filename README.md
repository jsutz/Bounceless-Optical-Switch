A circuit for detecting irregularly shaped objects as they pass through a pair of optical sensors

I created this circuit for detecting and counting a person (me) walking down and up stairs with minimal risk of duplicate counts. I use it with a counting circuit to track part of my daily exercise routine but it could work for other irregularly shaped objects traversing a space.

I've included a schematic of the circuit and a FreeCAD model of the assembled sensor circuit boards.

I designed the sensor boards in the model for use with corner cube array retro-reflectors. The LEDs specified have an 8Â° view angle so a 76mm diameter retro-reflector worked well for me over the 965mm width of my stair case.
